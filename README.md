# Udacity_Pytorch_challenge_Lab_Project
The final lab project is a classification problem , on the oxford 102 flower dataset. The dataset provided is biased , unbalanced and makes it uncertain to anticipate the test set.  

**Note :** My work is heavily influenced by all of these internal discussion advices and workaround suggested in the faq document (faqa_pytorch_scholarship)[https://github.com/ishgirwan/faqs_pytorch_scholarship] , the given notebook is not a solution but only provides how one can in Collab and can also use as a starting point. It's also based of on the Pytorch Transfer Learning tutorial. The scholarship is done for this year , but it was awesome no doubt. Chaotic at times but awesome none the less.  

* I got to be part of a large study group filled with people from various background  
* Got to know what the world is upto
* Formed a study group sg-genesis strictly focused on discussing papers
* helped a few people , learn to code and machine learning basics  

Overall it was fun
